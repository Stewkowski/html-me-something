           <h1>Just a few of the places I've never lived in.</h1>
           <p>The world we live in is pretty big, and, believe it or not, there are still some places left that I have yet to live in.  Here are a few.</p>

                    <h3>Nothing, AZ</h3>
                    <img src="images/Nothing-Arizona.jpg" alt="Nothing, Arizona" height="500" width="700"/>
                    <p>Nothing, Arizona is an uninhabited ghost town located in the eastern part of the Mohave Desert in Mohave County.  
                        It was established in 1977 and named by committee by a group of local drunks.  At its peak of prosperity, Nothing 
                        boasted a population of 4, a gas station, and a state-of-the-art convenience store.  The town was officially 
                        abandoned in 2005 and was bought by Mike Jensen in 2008 with the hopes of establishing a globally recognized 
                        Pizzeria empire, but, alas, his plans failed, and since 2011 the town has lain dormant once again.  It has been
                        speculated that since its abandonment the town has played host to various ghost orchestras, ufos on vacation in
                        search of local yokels to abduct, poltergeist activity, hippies in search of themselves, assorted serial killers, 
                        time traveling cowboy junkies, and the creatures from Tremors (possibly with Kevin Bacon in tow).  Like many people, 
                        I have never lived in Nothing, Arizona.</p>

                    <h3>Christ Church, Barbados</h3>
                    <img src="images/Christ-Church.jpg" alt="Christ Church, Barbados" height="500" width="700"/>
                    <p>Christ Church is a parish on the island of Barbados and is one of the original six colonies established by Sir William 
                        Tufton in 1629.  It is perhaps best known as being the birthplace of famous beatboxer and rapper Doug E. Fresh, and 
                        several famous Cricket players.  It seems to be a popular tourist destination and sports many beautiful beaches, if 
                        you’re into that kind of thing.  If you’re interested in visiting the Island, I would suggest staying away between the 
                        months of May through August when the island is most likely to be overrun by sunburnt baby boomers and Jimmy Buffet fans 
                        in search of their own personal Margaritaville and that ever elusive Cheeseburger in Paradise.  By all accounts it seems 
                        to be a pretty nice place to call home, but I wouldn’t know for sure, because, as of yet, I never have.</p>

                    <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
                    <img src="images/Tokyo-Japan.jpg" alt="Tokyo, Japan" height="500" width="700"/>
                    <p>Tokyo is the largest city in Japan and has served as the country’s capital since 1869, but it got its start as a humble fishing 
                        village called Edo which was established in the 14th century.  It’s population probably hovers somewhere between 5 and 50 million, 
                        but I don’t really know for sure.  The city also has the distinction of usually being portrayed as the capital (or at the very least, 
                        one of the few surviving metropolises) of a post-apocalyptic world in most cyber-punk fiction (The Neuromancer, Akira, etc. etc. etc.).  
                        It is speculated by most experts that by 2030 nearly half of the population will be replaced by robots and self-driving cars giving 
                        rides to robots who work at various robot factories in order to provide for their mostly robot families, but I digress…  As alluring 
                        as the opportunity for contemplation, self-actualization, and soul crushing silence, offered by Nothing, Arizona is; of all the places 
                        on this list, this would most likely be my first choice as my next place to call home.</p>

                    <h3>Greasy Corner, AK</h3>
                    <img src="images/Greasy-Corner.jpg" alt="Greasy Corner, AK" height="500" width="700"/>
                    <p>Greasy Corner is an unincorporated community located in St. Francis county Arkansas.  It was previously named Mack’s Corner, after Mack 
                        McCollum who ran a local store, restaurant, and automobile repair shop all out of the same building.  One day, a local farmer, dinning 
                        at the dinner was given a plate with a grease stain on it by a mechanic with grease stained coveralls and remarked that the town ought 
                        to be called Greasy Corner instead of Mack’s Corner.  The name stuck, the name was changed, and history was made.  Since then the 
                        businesses have all been shuttered, and Greasy spoon is home to only a handful of residents.  The town’s claim to fame is being named 
                        in multiple lists of towns with funny names, and it is on just such a list that the author discovered Greasy Corner, Arkansas.  As 
                        for its other claims to fame, I wouldn’t know, because I have never lived there.</p>

                    <h3>Zigzag, OR</h3>
                    <img src="images/Zigzag.jpeg" alt="The inn at Zigzag" height="500" width="700"/>
                    <p>Zigzag, Oregon is a village located in the Mount Hood corridor between Rhododendron and Welches (a town most likely named for its prodigious 
                        consumption of grape juice).  The town is named after the nearby Zigzag River, not the other thing you’re most likely thinking of (although 
                        I’m sure those receive a fare bit of use in this hazy little Oregon town…).  Zigzag is famous for its Inn, post office, and historic church, 
                        as well as, it’s number of Grateful dead and Phish cover bands per capita, which is quite alarming.  I’ve never had the honor of hearing one 
                        of these bands perform live, as I have never lived in Zigzag, Oregon.</p>
